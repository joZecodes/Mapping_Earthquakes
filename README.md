# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
For this module I used Leaflet.js (API) to populate a geographical map with earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake is visually represented by a colored circle where the higher the magnitude the diameter would become larger and the color would become darker. I also added a popup marker that will show the location and magnitude when clicked.
