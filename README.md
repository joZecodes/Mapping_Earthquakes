# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
For this module I used Leaflet.js (API) to populate a geographical map with earthquake data from a URL. Every earthquake is represented by a circle where the higher the magnitude of the earthquake the higher the diameter would become larger, and the color would also become darker. I also added a popup marker that will show the location and magnitude when clicked.
